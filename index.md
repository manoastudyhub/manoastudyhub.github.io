## About Manoa Study Hub

Manoa Study Hub will eventually provide a platform for students to organize study groups with each other while having in-person interactions in order to work on assignments, projects, or to prepare for tests. 

## Mock-Up Pages

Brief mock ups are provided for the pages that we plan to implement during Milestone 1.

## Team

### Goals

The goals that our group has for this project involves: gaining experience working as a group, creating a large-scale project, and learn and use new coding components. Most assignments in class so far have been individual work and so we want to learn how to coordinate with other people in order to achieve a final project. In addition, some of us believe this is a good opportunity to work on a large-scale project in comparison to the smaller assignments done throughout the semester. Finally, another goal we have is to learn new things and expand on the knowledge gained throughout the semester in areas such as React and Semantic UI.

Some skills that I would like to develop through working on this project would be to gain experience with working in groups. I would also like to enhance my skills of working with Meteor, Github, and Javascript. Some skills that I bring to the team are that I am acquainted with the concepts and areas that we have covered throughout this course.

What I hope to gain most by working on this project is experience working with a larger project with multiple team members, specifically with how to cooperate and communicate effectively and how to work with others through Github. I also want to improve my ability to work with Meteor and React. In terms of skillsets, I am capable of working with any of the material that was covered during the class.

I’m familiar with all the topics we’ve learned throughout the semester such as Javascript, html, react, semantic ui, meteor, etc. I wish to gain experience with working as a group. From this I hope to learn about task distribution amongst members in a team, time management and deadline awareness for completing tasks, and learning how to reconvene with fellow team members in order to produce a single project.

With this, project, I hope to develop skills in time management and coordinating myself in a group coding environment.  I am familiar with a handful of the concepts covered in class and I hope to contribute with what I learned throughout the semester.

Over the course of this project I hope to gain experience working in a team, using Github for version control and task management and managing time and deadlines. I also hope to further develop my skills working with Javascript, React, HTML/CSS and Meteor.
