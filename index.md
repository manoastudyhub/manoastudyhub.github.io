## Goals

The goals that our group has for this project involves: gaining experience working as a group, creating a large-scale project, and learn and use new coding components. Most assignments in class so far have been individual work and so we want to learn how to coordinate with other people in order to achieve a final project. In addition, some of us believe this is a good opportunity to work on a large-scale project in comparison to the smaller assignments done throughout the semester. Finally, another goal we have is to learn new things and expand on the knowledge gained throughout the semester in areas such as React and Semantic UI.
